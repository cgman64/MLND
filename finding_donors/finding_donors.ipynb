    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Gaussian Naive Bayes_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A real-world application where Gaussian Naive Bayes can be applied is e-mail spam detection. It is found that spam e-mail messages are more likely to contain specific words to try to draw in readers. With this in mind, it is possible to classify e-mails as spam given the words contained in messages. For example if an e-mail message contains the words \"cheap\", \"cash\", \"easy\" it can be inferred that the message is more likely to be spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model is a good choice for classifying messages a big reason for this is because it has the ability to handle each tokenized word as a feature. In other words it can handle a large amount of features and is even unaffected by irrelevant ones. In this case there are 103 features a relatively large amount of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main weakness to Gaussian Naive Bayes is the naive assumption that all events are independent of each other. The algorithm does not work well with dependent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model is a good candidate for this case because the data is very large and Gaussian Naive Bayes works well with large datasets. It can also serve as a baseline classification model that does not have to be tuned to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Decision Trees_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A real world  application of Decision Trees is predicting athlete salaries depending on factors such as years played, and performance metrics. For example baseball player salaries could be correlated with years of experience and number of hits. As such the algorithm could classify players with more than 5 years in the league and more than a certain number of hits as more likely to get paid more than those with less on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The advantage to decision trees is that it closely resembles human decision making as it is intuitive to understand we take into account various features before prediction. In this case we are trying to predict the salaries of individuals using features that are both categorical and numerical. Decision Trees can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A disadvantage to decision trees is that they can create overly complex trees and overfit to the data. With the amount of features we have in this case could mean we are vulnerable to creating a model that does not generlize well. Knowing this another danger is that in repetition a small change in data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree. Decision Trees are known for having high variance and the results can change depending on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Tree algorithm is suitable for this case because our dataset contains both numerical and categorical features and decision trees are adept at handling more than just one type of variable to make a yes or no type of prediction. Decision Trees are also better able to capture more robust decision boundaries than say a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_AdaBoost_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since a small change in the data can cause a large change in a decision tree, AdaBoost is used to aggregate many decision trees to improve the predictive performances. For example in the same example about baseball above, we know there are many factors to baseball player salaries as such a team can use AdaBoost and combine the strengths of different trees into one stronger tree that more closely captures the decision boundary for how much a player should or is paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since AdaBoost can be used to improve the performance of decision trees, it has all of the advantages of decision trees. The strength of AdaBoost lies in using many trees,  the trees themselves are 'weak' and can be only slight better than predicting at random, but combining these weak estimators can produce one robust strong estimator. Agrregating trees ensures lower variance in our estimates and we can be more sure of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AdaBoost can be more computationally expensive and can take more time in training than regular Decision Tree Classifiers. It can also perform poorly when the weak learners performs too poorly, that is worse than random. The weak learners should perform better than random.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AdaBoost is a good candidate for this task"

The Decision Tree algorithm will split the points into regions. One region for points with salary higher than \\\\$50K, and the other for those making less than or equal to \\\\$50K. The issue with using a single decision tree to perform estimates is that it is not generally viewed as the most accurate model and it has a higher variance on repetition meaning that results can vary more significantly on repetition. To mitigate these faults AdaBoost combines multiple decision trees as weak learners, and combines them into one strong learner to perform the final predictions. Because boosting Decision Tree with AdaBoost had better performance score on the testing set it was chosen as the final model. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The five features I believe to be the most important for prediction, in order of importance are: `age`, `education_level`, `occupation`, `workclass` and `hours-per-week`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two out of five of the features I discussed were chosen as the most relevant for prediction. They were `age`, `hours-per-week`. The other features were, `capital-gain`, `relationship_ Husband`, `education-num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `age` as I thought was determined to be the most important feature as it has significantly more weight than the other top 4 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The next most important feature was `hours-per-week`. I ranked this to be the 5th most important so it turns out this feature has more relevance than I thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It turns out that `education-num` is the quantitative form of `education_level`. The higher the number the higher the education level. As such the `education_level` dummy variables are redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Looking up the definition of capital gain in investopedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Capital gain is a rise in the value of a capital asset (investment or real estate) that gives it a higher worth than the purchase price. The gain is not realized until the asset is sold. A capital gain may be short-term (one year or less) or long-term (more than one year) and must be claimed on income taxes._\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ref: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "    Capital gain simply is the profit from the sale of real estate or an investment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    From this definition it can be inferred that those with higher income are more likely to own assets that they are able to make profit from selling.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The last feature, `relationship_ Husband` took me by surprise as I did not expect marital status to be relevant. I was also surprised that it was given slightly more weight than `education-num`. This seems to suggest that married men are more likely to make more money than non-married men. It is also interesting that `relationship_ Wife` was not chosen as this could suggest some gender pay inbalance."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
